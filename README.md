## Overview

### Links
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with
- Basic HTML and little bit of semantic HTML (<main>)
- Basic CSS properties. Also using the style guide, including hsl and font type
- I'm using flexbox to center the card
- I don't configure the mobile screen, because the card is already on center
- I use the box-shadow property for the card

### What I learned
After I finished this challenge, I got something new, like the HSL method. I will learn about it further more.
